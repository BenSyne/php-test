# Product Catalog System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of the pharmaceutical product catalog system for the Direct Meds pharmacy platform. The system includes comprehensive medication management, drug interaction checking, NDC lookup capabilities, and advanced search functionality.

## Database Schema

### Tables Implemented

1. **manufacturers** - Pharmaceutical company information
2. **categories** - Hierarchical medication categories with therapeutic classifications
3. **products** - Comprehensive medication data with pharmaceutical-specific fields

### Key Features

- **NDC Number Support**: National Drug Code tracking and lookup
- **DEA Schedule Classification**: Controlled substance tracking (CI, CII, CIII, CIV, CV)
- **Generic/Brand Relationships**: Links between brand and generic equivalents
- **Inventory Management**: Stock levels, expiration dates, reorder points
- **Clinical Data**: Active ingredients, interactions, warnings, contraindications
- **Regulatory Compliance**: FDA approval numbers, therapeutic equivalence codes

## Models

### Product Model (`app/Models/Product.php`)

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive fillable fields for pharmaceutical data
- JSON casting for arrays (drug_interactions, active_ingredients)
- Eloquent relationships (manufacturer, category, brand/generic equivalents)
- Query scopes for filtering (active, available, controlled, prescription, etc.)
- Computed attributes (is_expired, is_low_stock, stock_status)
- Helper methods for dispensing logic and interaction checking

**Sample Usage:**
```php
// Find a product by NDC
$product = Product::where('ndc_number', '0071-0222-23')->first();

// Check if product can be dispensed
if ($product->canDispense(30)) {
    // Proceed with dispensing
}

// Check drug interactions
if ($product->hasInteractionWith('Lithium')) {
    // Handle interaction warning
}

// Search products
$results = Product::search('lisinopril')->get();
```

### Category Model (`app/Models/Category.php`)

**Key Features:**
- Hierarchical structure with parent/child relationships
- Therapeutic class classification
- ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) codes
- Breadcrumb navigation support
- Descendant product retrieval

**Sample Usage:**
```php
// Get all products in a category and its subcategories
$products = $category->getProductsIncludingDescendants();

// Build category hierarchy
$hierarchy = Category::buildHierarchy();

// Get category breadcrumb
$breadcrumb = $category->breadcrumb; // ['Cardiovascular System', 'ACE Inhibitors']
```

### Manufacturer Model (`app/Models/Manufacturer.php`)

**Key Features:**
- Complete company contact information
- Product relationship management
- Formatted phone number display
- Active/inactive status management

## Controllers

### ProductController (`app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php`)

**API Endpoints:**

1. **GET /api/products** - Paginated product listing with advanced filtering
   - Search by name, brand, generic, NDC, description
